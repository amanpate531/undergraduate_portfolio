CSCI-Y 390: Undergraduate Independent Study

During the Fall semester, I was offered the opportunity to be an Undergraduate Researcher in Computing. For my research, I used MediaWiki API to scrape category data. I was able to visualize connections between the category data to discover unnoticed patterns. The purpose of this project was to familiarize with using third-party APIs in Python and to get a glimpse of common Data Science techniques such as data mining, cleaning, and analysis.
