		<h2> About the Research Process </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this research was to aid in brainstorming our final solution. Along the way, we faced some obstacles, including some conflict amongst the members of the group about even workloads. Nevertheless, using the research shown below, we were able to devise a solution to our scenario. </p>
		<p> As a group, we could've been more responsible with time management, as most of our assignments were submitted the night before or on the due date. In the future, doing group assignments ahead of time would eliminate any concerns of not being able to submit on time, and it would give group members plenty of time to revise and perfect their work. </p>
		<p> We began by thinking about ways we could collect and store large amounts of data and how we can get as many people as possible to enter the giveaway. In our brainstorming, we looked at how large-scale music festivals have worked in the past. We also wanted to know which method of entry would be most efficient for our giveaway, hence the SurveyMonkey survey. </p>
		<hr />
		<h2> Insights </h2>
		<p> Before we began the research for this project, most of us believed that collecting massive amounts of data would be a daunting task for festival producers. However, after researching, we have learned that it is a daunting task, but there are a vast sum of methods commonly used to collect, organize, and analyze this amount of data. </p>
		<p> Doing this research has given us a multitude of options for a potential solution, and we were able to combine some of the solutions illustrated in the research to formulate our final solution. </p>

		<h3> Source 1 (ACM): A Qualitative Evaluation of Technologies and Techniques for Data Collection on Pedestrians and Crowded Situations </h3>
		<p> In the paper “A Qualitative Evaluation of Technologies and Techniques for Data Collection on Pedestrians and Crowded Situations,” the author describes different methods of data collection for large groups of people. The paper begins with a brief explanation of five theories on how crowds are perceived and how they function. The author then describes five classifications of data collection methods, including Direct Observation, Scene analysis, Proximity Sensing, Continuous Localization Systems, and Sensor Networks. Following this section, the author dives deeper into the technologies that are commonly used for data collection. These include counting the members of a crowd, questionnaires, image and video processing, satellite positioning systems, inertial navigation, and RFID tracking. The author then provides an example of how each of these technologies is used in stadiums to collect data on their attendees. </p>
		<p> The information in this paper is important to our group because some of the data collection methods can be applied to giveaways at the event. For example, using Direct Observation and counting, a contest could be held to see if a festival attendee could guess the total number of attendees, and whoever wins would get free tickets for the next year’s event. </p>
		<h3> Source 2 (Academic): Big Data for Music Festivals </h3>
		<p> In the article “Big Data for Music Festivals,” the author describes a real-life example of the collection of massive amounts of data at a musical event. It begins by providing background on the Roskilde Festival, the event whose data was analyzed. The festival takes place in Northern Europe and has approximately 130,000 attendees annually. The data was collected in 2015 during a collaboration between the Copenhagen Business School and IBM. The purpose of collecting the data was to gain insights about the preferences of festival attendees and to expose any inefficiencies of the festival. The Roskilde Festival was chosen because the festival attendees represented the population of a complex modern city. Most of the data were collected using the smartphones of attendees. If they agreed to be tracked during the festival, their positions, eating habits, and musical performance preferences were recorded. Over 91 million tracking points were collected during the ten-day festival (Big Data). These unstructured data were used to analyze the movements of crowds, sales of food and beverages, the popularity of musical acts, weather data, and more. </p>
		<p> According to the article, using the smartphones of attendees to collect data was very efficient in a real-world situation, and a similar system could be used to collect contact information for giveaways. Prompting the attendees to enter the giveaway on their smartphones would prevent traffic from an in-person giveaway and it would make it much easier for the festival producer to get in contact with the winner of the giveaway. </p>
		<h3> Source 3 (Other): Event Marketing 101: How to Keep Attendees Engaged Before, During and After Your Event </h3>
		<p> In the essay “Event Marketing 101: How to Keep Attendees Engaged Before, During and After Your Event”, the author points out that the social media event marketing is so convenient that people could save a lot of time collecting information by using that. First, to do the social media event marketing, people must know what to post and where to post it in order to attract and appeal potential attendees. </p>
		<p> People could discover potential information and subtle thinking of the audience by using social media. Also, people could get the feedback in time on the event as well. There are many ways to ask the questions. The author writes four methods of promoting the festival on social media before it started. Then, she writes four ways for how to make other people know the festival during the festival. Lastly, the author supports two ways for how to share the festival on social when the festival is ended. According to these, the author writes 10 ways to help other people know how to make a good festival. </p>
		<h3> Source 4 (Other): iHeartRadio Contests </h3>
		<p> After exploring the iHeartRadio website and what it has to offer, it seems like this source would work well for our project. The site heavily promotes giveaways to different concerts, festivals and even music related items. iHeartRadio has a main website, and multiple social media accounts they use to help promote their giveaways. They seem to be effective in their promotion because they branch out to people in multiple ways. They reach out to people through social media, and radio giving them an effective advantage.  Everything pertaining to their giveaways seems to be organized and updated. We should use this website in our project because of the various ways they market their giveaways. We can use their strategies as ideas to start developing our own giveaway marketing strategies. We will be able to either use them to spark our own ideas or even improve upon what they have developed. </p>
		<p> iHeartRadio pertains to our problem because they do ultimately the same thing as we are planning. We are both looking for the best way to market festival giveaways. We will be able to get ideas from researching and exploring their social media accounts to develop our own, and our website. I believe that they will give us a solid place to begin coming up with our own genius ideas for marketing music festival giveaways as they seem to be the best source I have found as of right now. </p>
		<h3> Source 5 (Other): Why Is Social Media Important For Businesses? </h3>
		<p> In the article, “Why is Social Media Important for Businesses,” it becomes clear that social media is necessary for any successful venture in today's market. It explains that social media is a way to gauge how to involve the customers/Fanbase are. It also explains that social media is a tool or channel for marketing and aids in the helping brands build their visibility. The article states that 73.4% of users follow a brand because of their interest product or service. Seeing the brand on Device as opposed to a TV or commercial allows for more interaction and a more personal experience. Assuming the product is desirable, one has the benefit of reading comments but maybe positive reviews or hype about the product or event respectively. </p>
		<p> This information is extremely important to our scenario. Social media may be the most relevant, cost-effective way to relay information to the customer. First, it is exponentially cooler then word-of-mouth or regular advertisements. Customers interaction allows for a more personal experience that may prove beneficial to the sale of tickets. Secondly, is more attractive than advertisements because people generally hate advertisements. Everybody who signs up to see our brand is genuinely interested and success and events that go along with it. Also, it is much easier to Instant message a video of an artist to your friend and it is to send a YouTube video and hope that each of you got the same ad in the beginning. Finally, social media allows for exponential growth. With just one retweet an advertisement may see double or triple the amount of people that it was originally marketed to. It is not hard to believe at any given star marketing a concert that they look to perform at could get several thousand retweets on any given post. There is no doubt that social media is absolutely essential to the success of modern business. </p>
		<h3> Source 6 (Other): How to Use Social Media to Gather Valuable Marketing Data </h3>
		<p> In the essay “How to Use Social Media to Gather Valuable Marketing Data”, the author points out that social media is all about making connections and building relationships. The social media provides a great way for the marketers to know what the public think about something that they care. They could use social media to gather data and information in several different ways. First, real-time could be one of the biggest advantages of social media. To be more specific, in the past it is hard for people to find the data or comments on time because social media cannot allow this. But now Facebook offers a wonderful way for people to put their own thinking or idea on the internet whatever they want as soon as possible. If the people pay attention to the Audience Insights piece of Ad Manager, they could target the audience you're aiming for successfully (Syme). Secondly, one of the main purposes of social media is to drive traffic to specific pages of your website. People could connect the information they already have with the pages that the audience like together to make their own work. It could be much easier for the people to combine the specific page of the internet that the audience when they analysis. The social media makes things clear for the marketers to target and design their product. As a result, social media could be an important part when we do research. </p>
		<h3> Source 7 (Other): Techspectations: Why identifying true, reliable data is the key </h3>
		<p> The article “Why identifying true, reliable data is the key” is based on a panel discussion that took place at this year's Digital Summit. He begins by talking about how film producers use data to decide when to release new films. This is absolutely applicable to our project. Regarding scenario six, we could do something similar regarding what and when we should get away. We may find out that some items that we plan to giveaway are preferable two other items. Maybe sneakers are cooler the sweatshirt, maybe it's better to do a giveaway at 3 PM than 10 AM. A process similar to what he does with data would be invaluable to our plan. He goes on to say the opposite of what many seem to think. he says that the service provided should be completely focused on data. What he means is that someone should collect data, and then decide to service they want to offer. Not the other way around. They should not pick out a service and then find data to support their decision, because there may be a positive skew in their results. </p>
		<p> He said the most important thing is an attribution model. Most people look at the attribution models solely for what they are, but if one looks at it from a holistic standpoint everything that is necessary to the success a business becomes clear. He explained that it is challenging to discern ‘fake data’ from real data. Fake data is made up of everything from mistakes/ Errors having to do with user input, to bots designed to replicate traffic. He explained that the easiest way to discern the two was by way analytics, specifically the attribution model from above. Once a company can normalize their data and figure out their base customer profiles, in their respective desires, there is no limit to the power of personalized marketing. This is absolutely essential for our scenario because we must market our giveaways to be looked at favorably as opposed to hassle.</p>
