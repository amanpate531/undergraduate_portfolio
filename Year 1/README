Freshman Year

Courses:
  1. CSCI-C 211: Introduction to Computer Science (Racket)
  2. CSCI-C 241: Discrete Structures for Computer Science - No programming, only written assignments dealing with logic and semantics.
  
This was the first year of my undergraduate studies, and at the time I was a Mathematics major. Coursework this year exposed me to Computer Science, piquing my interest and influencing my change in major.
