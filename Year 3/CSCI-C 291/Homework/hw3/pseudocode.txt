// To begin, the user is presented with a menu. They are prompted to select
// First, Business, or Economy

// After they make their selection, a seat is randomly chosen for them.

// If it is an Aisle or Window seat, the user is asked if it is acceptable

// Depending on their response, the seat is booked or a random seat is
// generated

// Once the seat is booked, the user is prompted to select a secondary option
// Seating chart, passenger manifest, or boarding pass

// Various conditions are added that permit the concatenation of integers and
// strings for seat numbers.

// The loop continues until all 72 passengers are accounted for.
