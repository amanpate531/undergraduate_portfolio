CSCI-B 403: Introduction to Algorithm Design & Analysis

In this course we learned about a variety of algorithms and their runtimes. These included sorting and searching algorithms, applications of the Greedy algorithm, Huffman coding, and more. As this class was purely conceptual, we did not implement any of these algorithms. However, the conceptual assignments are important to include, as they are a good representation of my thinking and problem-solving process.
