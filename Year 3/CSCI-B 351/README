CSCI-B 351: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

In this course we learned about the fundamentals of artificial intelligence as well as some practical applications. Topics discussed include propositional and first-order logic, search algorithms, game theory, decision trees, neural networks, and more.

The course contained a variety of programming assignments covering material from the basics of Python to machine learning packages such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NumPy. Unfortunately, my professor explicitly stated that course material cannot be posted outside of the class, including on GitHub.
